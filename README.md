## Problem Statement
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting airline passenger traffic by using ARIMA and SARIMAX models to help stakeholders predict future trends. By leveraging time series analysis, the project provides insights into passenger patterns, helping airlines optimize operations, manage resources efficiently, and improve decision-making for future demand planning.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this project includes monthly totals of international airline passengers from January 1949 to December 1960:

‚óè **Passengers:** Monthly counts of airline passengers, which serve as the primary data for forecasting.

**Steps Followed**

**Step 1:** Load the dataset into the analysis environment for initial exploration.

**Step 2:** Perform data preprocessing, including handling missing values and setting up a time index.

**Step 3:** Apply ARIMA and SARIMAX models to capture the underlying trends and seasonality in the passenger data.

**Step 4:** Generate predictions using the trained models and compare them against the actual data.

**Step 5:** Visualize the original data, model predictions, and future forecasts to provide clear insights into passenger trends.

### Key Features
‚óè **Time Series Analysis:** Utilize ARIMA and SARIMAX models to analyze and forecast passenger traffic.

‚óè **Trend and Seasonality Detection:** Identify and model underlying patterns in the data.

‚óè **Future Forecasting:** Predict future passenger numbers to assist in planning and decision-making.

‚óè **Visualizations:** Present data and predictions through line plots for easy interpretation.

## Insights
‚óè **Passenger Growth Trends:** Understand how passenger numbers have changed over time.

‚óè **Seasonal Patterns:** Identify recurring seasonal trends that impact passenger traffic.

‚óè **Model Comparison:** Evaluate the performance of ARIMA and SARIMAX models in forecasting.

## Conclusion
The Airline Passenger Traffic Forecasting project is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting trends in airline passenger numbers. By providing a clear view of historical data and future forecasts, it aids airlines and airports in making data-driven decisions that enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Future Work
**Regular Updates:** Incorporate more recent data to keep the forecasts current.

**Model Enhancements:** Explore more advanced forecasting models to improve accuracy.

**Broader Applications:** Apply the analysis to different regions or airlines to gain more specific insights.
